        <p>
            I have taken care to try and make this site a reasonably safe, comfortable experience.
            However, you must still exercise caution. Neither I nor the site's hosts may be held
            personally responsible for irresponsible use of this site.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can always <b>escape the spiral immediately</b> by pressing the spacebar, pressing the escape key twice,
            or tapping on the bottom-right corner of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please ensure that you are comfortable with any "subliminal" text present in the list before
            using the spiral - it is empty by default, of course, but users are capable of sharing links
            with a pre-set configuration for the spiral. <b>If someone sends you a link, check to make sure
            you are okay with its settings.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            As with anything displayed on a screen, staring at this site for too long could cause eye strain or
            other longer-term issues. Be mindful of your health, wear glasses if needed, and take breaks.
            If you are particularly sensitive to spirals, you may want to set some sort of timer or alarm before
            starting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spiral should only ever display messages that have been provided as input in the message box, and should
            always obey your settings (unless some sort of bug occurs to break this.)
            You may inspect the full source code of the site <a href="https://github.com/furrz/hypnospiral">here</a>.
