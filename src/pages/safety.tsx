      This site is designed with safety in mind, but <b>your mind is still your own responsibility</b>
      - always check the subliminal messages before staring at a spiral, and ensure you can escape safely
      if need be.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock>
      As with anything on a screen, staring for too long may cause eye strain - be cautious and take breaks.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock>
      I cannot moderate the spirals created with this site. Spiral settings are stored within the URL of the page.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock>
      Press space, press escape twice, or tap the bottom-right corner of the screen to exit a spiral.
