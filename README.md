## âœ¨ Key Features

- Deeply customizable: Control everything from spiral speed and colors to subliminal messages and overlay effects.

- Modern tech stack: Built with React, TypeScript, and webpack for a robust and maintainable codebase.

- Clean client-Side routing: Uses BrowserRouter for standard, shareable URLs, resolving previous routing complexities.

- Synchronized & Safe State: Settings are saved in real-time using a synchronized useLocalStorage hook, which safely handles server-side rendering environments.

- Performance-Oriented: Designed to be lightweight and performant, even with complex animations.

- Safety first: Includes important safety information and considerations for users.

## Project Structure

This project is structured as a static website, using webpack to compile the TypeScript source into JS bundles.

To start a local development server, use `npm run dev`.

### Directory Structure

- `web` - Static content, copied directly to the root of the static output.
- `src` - Typescript source code for the actual app.
  - `assets` - Icons and other assets referenced by components in the app.
  - `components` - Definitions of React components.
    - `building_blocks.tsx` - Basic, reusable components for building the app's UI. Buttons, menus, etc.
    - `app.tsx` - The root component and router of the application.
  - `pages` - Definitions of pages of UI shown in the app. Most of these are routed to from somewhere via 
    `components/app.tsx`.
  - `util` - General utility code, such as timers, array helpers, etc.
  - `features` - Individual features go in here, creating a vertical slice architecture that separates them cleanly from
     the main app, and keeps their related files grouped together for easy editing.
    - `[feature name]`
      - `component[.tsx]` - The React component(s) associated with this feature.
      - `customize[.tsx]` - The customization page(s) associated with this feature.
      - `state.ts` - Defines shared state associated with this feature. Usually, these are `hashState`, which is stored
        in the hash (`#`) part of the page URL for easy sharing.

### Testing

Use `npm run test` to run all tests using vitest.

Tests are defined in `[filename].test.ts`, which should appear alongside the associated ts or tsx module being tested.

Testing React and DOM/Browser-related features can be tricky.
As much behaviour as possible should be kept abstracted away from UI and browser concerns, for easier testing.
